My newsite is about plants, because I love plants.

## The problem

As I was developing the project, I encountered some challenges with the HTML tags, particularly with forgetting to properly close certain tags, which resulted in an unexpected output. To address this, I meticulously reviewed the markup to ensure everything was correctly structured.

I also faced difficulties in manipulating image sizes through CSS, leading me to adjust these dimensions directly in the HTML.

Additionally, I aimed to implement some captions for the images, but encountered issues that prevented this from functioning as intended. Interestingly, the same code worked seamlessly in CodePen, which indicated that the problem was specific to my current environment. After several attempts to troubleshoot, I decided to prioritize other aspects of the project.

Throughout the development process, I extensively utilized CodePen as a testing ground for various concepts and features.

Given more time and patience, I would dedicate additional effort to refine the design further and incorporate extra features to enhance the overall user experience.
